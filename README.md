# Logistic Regression on Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset

## Overview  
This repository implements a **logistic regression** model to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a publicly available dataset. The project includes:

- **kidney_disease.csv**: Raw dataset containing patient attributes and CKD status.  
- **Kidney_disease_classification_problem_Rishi.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating data processing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps.

---

## Dataset  
The `kidney_disease.csv` file includes features such as:
- Numerical: age, blood pressure, RBC count, WBC count, albumin, sugar levels, etc.
- Categorical: presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, edema, etc.
- Target label: whether the patient has CKD.

*(Add details about dataset source, number of records, missing values, and attribute descriptions.)*
